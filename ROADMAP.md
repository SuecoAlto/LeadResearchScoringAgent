Lead Research & Scoring Agent – Project Roadmap & Checklist

🚀 Objective

Build an AI-powered agent that researches incoming leads, scores them, finds decision-makers, retrieves company locations, and generates personalized call scripts using Advanced RAG techniques to optimize accuracy and retrieval efficiency.

1️⃣ Database Selection & Justification

Since we are working with lead data, the database must be:
✅ Fast and scalable
✅ Easy to integrate with APIs
✅ Low-cost or free during the demo phase
✅ Capable of handling structured data (company info, scoring, call scripts, etc.)

Database Options

🔹 Supabase (Recommended) – PostgreSQL-based
	•	Free up to 500MB storage & 50,000 requests per month
	•	Offers REST & GraphQL APIs → Easy integration with LangChain
	•	Built-in authentication & role management if needed in the future
	•	Postgres-based, making it scalable for production

🔹 SQLite – Lightweight & Local
	•	File-based, no server needed → Perfect for local testing
	•	Not suitable for multi-user production

🔹 Firestore (Firebase NoSQL)
	•	Cost-efficient, but optimized for unstructured data
	•	Difficult to perform complex queries

✅ Decision: Supabase – Best balance of scalability, API support, and cost-effectiveness for the demo phase.

2️⃣ Advanced RAG for Lead Research & Data Gathering

To efficiently collect, retrieve, and enhance lead & company information, we will use:

Approach

✔️ Web Scraping + Hybrid Retrieval (RAG) using LangChain
✔️ Embedding models for enhanced lead scoring & research
✔️ Memory-enhanced contextual search

Data Sources

🔹 Web Scraping (Google, LinkedIn, company websites)
	•	🚨 Can be slow & might violate ToS

🔹 Free APIs
	•	OpenCorporates API → Business information
	•	DuckDuckGo/Google Search API → General company data
	•	LinkedIn (Manual Input) → User provides LinkedIn URL

🔹 Paid APIs (If needed in future)
	•	Clearbit / People Data Labs → Enriched company & personal data
	•	Apollo.io → Contact details but requires a subscription

Implementation with Advanced RAG
	•	Use LangChain’s Vector Store (e.g., FAISS, Chroma) to index and retrieve leads efficiently
	•	Convert structured company research data into embeddings for similarity-based retrieval
	•	Enhance contextual search with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve response relevance

✅ Decision: Start with Scraping + OpenCorporates API + LangChain RAG Pipeline, add DuckDuckGo if needed.

3️⃣ Lead Scoring – Rule-Based vs. Machine Learning

Two methods to evaluate leads:

🟢 Rule-Based Scoring (Simple & Fast)
	•	Uses predefined rules, e.g.:
	•	If company has >100 employees → High score
	•	If it’s a startup → Medium score
	•	If no contact person found → Low score
✔️ Pros: Easy to implement, no data training required
❌ Cons: Hard to scale for multiple industries

🤖 Machine Learning Scoring (Advanced, Future-proof)
	•	Trains a model using historical data to predict lead quality
	•	Uses NLP models for sentiment analysis on company descriptions
✔️ Pros: Adapts over time, better accuracy
❌ Cons: Requires training data, longer implementation

RAG for Lead Scoring
	•	Use similarity-based retrieval to find historical leads & compare scores
	•	Fine-tune retrieval pipeline to dynamically suggest scoring based on previous success patterns

✅ Decision: Start with Rule-Based Scoring + RAG-based retrieval, but prepare for ML integration later.

4️⃣ Call Script Generation – RAG-Enhanced Dynamic vs. Template-Based

📌 Two approaches to generating personalized call scripts:

🎯 RAG-Enhanced AI Call Script Generation
	•	Uses LangChain’s Retrieval-Augmented Generation to personalize scripts dynamically
✔️ Pros: Highly customized, contextual responses
❌ Cons: Might require fine-tuning for consistency

📄 Template-Based Call Script
	•	Predefined templates for different industries (e.g., SaaS, Retail, Finance)
✔️ Pros: Consistent, controlled messaging
❌ Cons: Less adaptability

✅ Decision: Use AI Prompt-Based Call Scripts with RAG, with template fallback if needed.

5️⃣ UI & User Interaction – Telegram/WhatsApp First, Web UI Later

Instead of building a UI from scratch, we will:
✅ Use Telegram or WhatsApp Bots to collect & return data
✅ Transition to a Web UI later

📲 Telegram Bot API (Recommended)
	•	Free & easy to set up
	•	Allows real-time interaction with the agent
📲 WhatsApp API (Alternative)
	•	Requires business verification, delays setup

✅ Decision: Start with Telegram, build a Web UI later.

✅ Checklist: Implementation Roadmap

1️⃣ Setup & Core Configuration

✅ Initialize Git repository & setup file structure
✅ Install LangChain, Supabase-py, and necessary dependencies
✅ Configure Supabase database (tables for leads, research, scoring)
✅ Set up .env file for API keys

2️⃣ Advanced RAG for Lead Research & Data Collection

✅ Implement web scraping + Hybrid RAG-based retrieval pipeline
✅ Integrate OpenCorporates API for company data
✅ Store research data as embeddings for better retrieval
✅ Implement similarity-based lead lookups

3️⃣ Lead Scoring Implementation

✅ Develop rule-based scoring system (e.g., company size, industry)
✅ Implement RAG-based dynamic lead scoring retrieval
✅ Plan ML integration (for future versions)
✅ Test different scoring mechanisms

4️⃣ Database Integration

✅ Implement Supabase integration for storing lead data
✅ Write functions to save & retrieve lead information
✅ Store lead history as vector embeddings for RAG retrieval

5️⃣ Call Script Generation with RAG

✅ Build GPT-powered dynamic call script generation
✅ Integrate RAG pipeline for context-aware call scripts
✅ Implement fallback templates for missing data
✅ Test script variations to ensure consistency

6️⃣ UI & Telegram Bot Integration

✅ Setup Telegram Bot API for chat-based lead input
✅ Implement agent response system via chat
✅ Return research & lead scores directly in Telegram
✅ Conduct user testing & iterate

7️⃣ Testing & Deployment

✅ Write unit tests for research, scoring, and database functions
✅ Deploy a free version on a cloud platform (e.g., Railway, Render)
✅ Document setup & usage instructions in README

📌 Summary & Execution Plan

1️⃣ Database: Supabase (best API support & free for demo).
2️⃣ Lead Research: Scraping + OpenCorporates API + RAG-based retrieval (cost-effective & scalable).
3️⃣ Lead Scoring: Rule-based initially, enhanced by RAG retrieval, future support for ML.
4️⃣ Call Script: GPT-based dynamic generation, RAG-enhanced contextual scripts, fallback templates.
5️⃣ UI: Telegram bot first, move to a web app later.

📌 Target Milestone: A functional RAG-powered prototype, followed by iterative improvements.
