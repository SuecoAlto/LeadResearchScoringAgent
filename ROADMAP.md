# **Lead Research & Scoring Agent – Project Roadmap & Checklist**  

## 🚀 **Objective**  
Build an AI-powered agent that researches incoming leads, scores them, finds decision-makers, retrieves company locations, and generates personalized call scripts using **LangChain** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  

---

## **1️⃣ Database Selection & Justification**  
Since we are working with lead data, the database must be:  
👉 **Fast and scalable**  
👉 **Easy to integrate with APIs**  
👉 **Low-cost or free during the demo phase**  
👉 **Capable of handling structured data (company info, scoring, call scripts, etc.)**  

### **Database Options**  
🔹 **Supabase (Recommended) – PostgreSQL-based**  
- Free up to **500MB storage & 50,000 requests per month**  
- Offers **REST & GraphQL APIs** → Easy integration with LangChain  
- Built-in **authentication & role management** if needed in the future  
- **Postgres-based**, making it **scalable for production**  

🔹 **SQLite – Lightweight & Local**  
- **File-based**, no server needed → Perfect for **local testing**  
- **Not suitable for multi-user production**  

🔹 **Firestore (Firebase NoSQL)**  
- **Cost-efficient**, but optimized for **unstructured data**  
- **Difficult to perform complex queries**  

👉 **Decision: Supabase** – Best balance of **scalability, API support, and cost-effectiveness** for the demo phase.

## **2️⃣ Lead Research & RAG Integration**  
To collect company & lead information **efficiently and accurately**, we will use:  

### **Approach**  
👉 **Web Scraping** (Cost-effective but limited)  
👉 **Free APIs**  
👉 **Paid APIs (if needed later)**  
👉 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for structured lead research**  

### **Data Sources**  
🔹 **Web Scraping** (Google, LinkedIn, company websites)  
- 🚨 Can be **slow** & might violate **ToS**  

🔹 **Free APIs**  
- **OpenCorporates API** → Business information  
- **DuckDuckGo/Google Search API** → General company data  
- **LinkedIn (Manual Input)** → User provides LinkedIn URL  

🔹 **Paid APIs (If needed in future)**  
- **Clearbit / People Data Labs** → Enriched company & personal data  
- **Apollo.io** → Contact details but requires a subscription  

👉 **Decision: Start with** **Scraping + OpenCorporates API**, add **DuckDuckGo** if needed.

## **3️⃣ Lead Scoring – Rule-Based vs. Machine Learning**  
Two methods to evaluate leads:  

🟢 **Rule-Based Scoring (Simple & Fast)**  
- Uses **predefined rules**, e.g.:  
  - If company has **>100 employees** → **High score**  
  - If it's a **startup** → **Medium score**  
  - If no contact person found → **Low score**  
👉 **Pros**: Easy to implement, no data training required  
👉 **Cons**: Hard to scale for multiple industries  

🤖 **Machine Learning Scoring (Advanced, Future-proof)**  
- Trains a **model** using historical data to predict lead quality  
- Uses **NLP & RAG** to analyze descriptions & research data  
👉 **Pros**: Adapts over time, better accuracy  
👉 **Cons**: Requires **training data**, longer implementation  

👉 **Decision: Start with** **Rule-Based Scoring**, but **prepare for ML integration** later.  

---

## **4️⃣ Call Script Generation with RAG**  

📌 **Two approaches to generating personalized call scripts:**  

🔗 **AI Prompt-Based Call Script with RAG**  
- Uses **GPT + Retrieval-Augmented Generation** to dynamically generate scripts based on research  
👉 **Pros**: Personalized, flexible, can adapt to any lead  
👉 **Cons**: Output may vary in quality  

🌍 **Template-Based Call Script**  
- Predefined templates for **different industries** (e.g., SaaS, Retail, Finance)  
👉 **Pros**: **Consistent**, controlled messaging  
👉 **Cons**: Less adaptability  

👉 **Decision: Use** **AI Prompt-Based Call Scripts with RAG**, with **template fallback** if needed.  

---

## **5️⃣ UI & User Interaction**  
👉 **Start with Telegram/WhatsApp for easy testing**  
👉 **Build a Web UI later for better user experience**  

---

# **✅ Checklist: Implementation Roadmap**

📌 Summary & Execution Plan

1️⃣ Database: Supabase (best API support & free for demo).  
2️⃣ Lead Research: Scraping + OpenCorporates API + RAG-based retrieval (cost-effective & scalable).  
3️⃣ Lead Scoring: Rule-based initially, enhanced by RAG retrieval, future support for ML.  
4️⃣ Call Script: GPT-based dynamic generation, RAG-enhanced contextual scripts, fallback templates.  
5️⃣ UI: Telegram bot first, move to a web app later.  

📌 Target Milestone: A functional RAG-powered prototype, followed by iterative improvements.
